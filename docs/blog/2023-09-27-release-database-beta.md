# Release database beta

_Release package `@rster/database@0.1.0 (beta)`_ ðŸ¥³

Hello everyone,

I am very happy to announce today that the first beta version of the `@rster/database` package has been released.
You can find the package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rster/database). `@rster/database` is a database layer for rster. At the moment we support the following databases:

- MongoDB
- Json File
- Javascript Object (in memory)

More databases will follow in the future. MongoDB Adapter is required to be installed separately. You can find the package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rster/database-adapter-mongodb). Install it via `npm install @rster/database-adapter-mongodb`

Tutorial and documentation will follow soon.

Have fun with the new package and stay healthy.
