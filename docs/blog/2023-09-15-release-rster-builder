# Release `@rster/builder@0.1.0`

Hello everyone,

I just wanted to share some small, but very exciting news with you today. I decided to release 
`@rster/builder` module as I think that it, in its current state, is ready to be used. Some tutorials
for it will follow in the next couple of days. as of right now you can explore it, it is fully documented
with typedoc and not very complicated as well.

Have a great time exploring the package! ðŸ˜‰
